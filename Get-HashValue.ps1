or later.

.DESCRIPTION
Get-HashValue uses the inbuilt Get-FileHash cmdlet in machines that have PowerShell
version 4 or later installed and .NET Framework in machines that are running
PowerShell version 2 or 3 for file analysation and for calculating the hash values.
MD5, SHA256, SHA1, SHA384, SHA512, MACTripleDES and RIPEMD160 hash values are
automatically displayed for files that are defined with the -FilePath parameter.
To show only a certain hash type, the parameter -Algorithm may be added to the
launching command.

The -FilePath parameter accepts plain filenames (then the current directory gets
searched for the inputted filename) or 'FullPath' filenames, which include the path
to the file as well (such as C:\Windows\explorer.exe). To enter multiple files for
analysation, please separate each individual entity with a comma. If the filename or
the directory name includes space characters, please enclose the whole string
(the individual entity in question) in quotation marks (single or double).

If any hash values are found, a text file (hash_values.txt) is created to
$env:temp, which points to the current temporary file location and is set in the
system (- for more information about $env:temp, please see the Notes section).
The default output destination folder may be changed with the -Output parameter.
During the possibly invoked text file creation procedure Get-HashValue tries to
preserve any pre-existing content rather than overwrite the file, so if the text
file already exists in the defined -Output folder, new data is appended to the end
of that file. Please note that if any of the parameter values include space
characters, the value should be enclosed in quotation marks (single or double) so
that PowerShell can interpret the command correctly.

.PARAMETER FilePath
with aliases -FilenameWithPathName, -FullPath, -Source, and -File. The -FilePath
parameter determines, which file(s) is/are selected for hash value calculation, and
in essence define the objects for Get-HashValue.

The -FilePath parameter accepts plain filenames (then the current directory gets
searched for the inputted filename) or 'FullPath' filenames, which include the path
to the file as well (such as C:\Windows\explorer.exe). To enter multiple files for
analysation, please separate each individual entity with a comma. If the filename or
the directory name includes space characters, please enclose the whole string
(the individual entity in question) in quotation marks (single or double). It's not
mandatory to write -FilePath in the get hash value command to invoke the -FilePath
parameter, as is shown in the Examples below, since Get-HashValue is trying to
decipher the inputted queries as good as it is machinely possible within a 40 KB
size limit. The -FilePath parameter also takes an array of strings and objects
could be piped to this parameter, too. If no value for the -FilePath parameter
is defined in the command launching Get-HashValue, the user will be prompted to
enter a -FilePath value.

.PARAMETER Output
with an alias -ReportPath. Specifies where the text file (hash_values.txt, which is
created or updated with successfully calculated hash values) is to be saved. The
text file includes the hash values and a timestamp, when the values were calculated.
The default save location is $env:temp, which points to the current temporary file
location, which is set in the system. The default -Output save location is defined
at line 16 with the $Output variable. In case the path name includes space
characters, please enclose the path name in quotation marks (single or double).
For usage, please see the Examples below and for more information about $env:temp,
please see the Notes section below.

.PARAMETER Algorithm
with aliases -Type, -Hash, -HashType, -Version and -Algo. If the -Algorithm
parameter is added to the command launching Get-HashValue, only the defined type of
hash value of the object file(s) is displayed and written to the text file. The valid
values for -Algorithm parameter are MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, MACTripleDES
or RIPEMD160. For best results, please specify only one valid value for -Algorithm
parameter in one get hash value command. To make the -Algorithm parameter accept
multiple values may be the focus of further development in Get-HashValue.
If no -Algorithm parameter is defined in the command launching Get-HashValue, all
the available hash values (i.e. MD5, SHA256, SHA1, SHA384, SHA512, MACTripleDES and
RIPEMD160) are displayed and written to a text file.


.OUTPUTS
Displays information about hash values in console, and if any hash values were
successfully calculated, writes or updates a text file (hash_values.txt) at
$env:temp by default or at the location specified with the -Output parameter.


    Default values (the text file creation/updating procedure only occurs, if
    hash values are successfully calculated by Get-HashValue):


        $env:temp\hash_values.txt       : TXT-file     : hash_values.txt


.NOTES
Please note that all the parameters can be used in one get hash value command
and that each of the parameters can be "tab completed" before typing them fully (by
pressing the [tab] key).

Please note that the default text file name (hash_values.txt) is defined at
line 29 with the $txt_filename variable.

Please note that the possibly generated text file is created in a directory,
which is end-user settable in each get hash value command with the -Output
parameter. The default save location is defined with the $Output variable (at
line 16). The $env:temp variable points to the current temp folder. The default
value of the $env:temp variable is C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp
(i.e. each user account has their own separate temp folder at path
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Temp). To see the current temp path, for instance
a command

    [System.IO.Path]::GetTempPath()

may be used at the PowerShell prompt window [PS>]. To change the temp folder for
instance to C:\Temp, please, for example, follow the instructions at

.EXAMPLE
./Get-HashValue a_certain_filename.exe
Run the script. Please notice to insert ./ or .\ before the script name.
The current directory gets searched for the inputted filename
"a_certain_filename.exe") and if any hash values were successfully calculated, the
text file is saved to the default location ($env:temp). During the possibly invoked
text file creation procedure Get-HashValue tries to preserve any pre-existing content
rather than overwrite the file, so if the text file (hash_values.txt) already
exists, new data is appended to the end of that file.

.EXAMPLE
help ./Get-HashValue -Full
Display the help file.

.EXAMPLE
./Get-HashValue -FilePath "C:\Windows\explorer.exe" -Output "C:\Scripts"

Run the script and get the MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, MACTripleDES and
RIPEMD160 hash values from the "C:\Windows\explorer.exe" file and if any hash values
were successfully calculated, save the text file to C:\Scripts. Please note, that
-FilePath can be omitted in this example, because

    ./Get-HashValue "C:\Windows\explorer.exe" -Output "C:\Scripts"

will result in the exact same outcome.

.EXAMPLE
./Get-HashValue -Source "C:\Users\Dropbox\a certain filename.exe" -Algorithm SHA256

Will display the SHA256 hash value of "C:\Users\Dropbox\a certain filename.exe"
in console and write it to a text file, which is saved to the default location
($env:temp). This command will work, because -Source is an alias of -FilePath.
The -FilePath (a.k.a. -Source a.k.a. -FilenameWithPathName a.k.a. -FullPath
a.k.a. -File) variable value is case-insensitive (as is most of the
PowerShell), but since the filename contains space characters, the whole FullPath
value needs to be enveloped with quotation marks. The -Source parameter may be
left out from this command, since, for example,

    ./Get-HashValue "c:\users\dROPBOx\A Certain Filename.exe" -Algorithm SHA256

is the exact same command in nature.

.EXAMPLE
./Get-HashValue -FilePath "C:\Windows\explorer.exe", "C:\Users\Dropbox\a_certain_filename.exe"

Will display the hash values of "C:\Windows\explorer.exe" and
"C:\Users\Dropbox\a_certain_filename.exe" in console and write them to a text file,
which is saved to the default location ($env:temp). Since the -FilePath values don't
contain any space characters, they don't need to be enveloped with quotation marks,
because

    ./Get-HashValue C:\Windows\explorer.exe, C:\Users\Dropbox\a_certain_filename.exe

would result in the same outcome.

.EXAMPLE
Set-ExecutionPolicy remotesigned
This command is altering the Windows PowerShell rights to enable script execution for
the default (LocalMachine) scope. Windows PowerShell has to be run with elevated rights
(run as an administrator) to actually be able to change the script execution properties.
The default value of the default (LocalMachine) scope is "Set-ExecutionPolicy restricted".


    Parameters:

    Restricted      Does not load configuration files or run scripts. Restricted is the default
                    execution policy.

    AllSigned       Requires that all scripts and configuration files be signed by a trusted
                    publisher, including scripts that you write on the local computer.

    RemoteSigned    Requires that all scripts and configuration files downloaded from the Internet
                    be signed by a trusted publisher.

    Unrestricted    Loads all configuration files and runs all scripts. If you run an unsigned
                    script that was downloaded from the Internet, you are prompted for permission
                    before it runs.

    Bypass          Nothing is blocked and there are no warnings or prompts.

    Undefined       Removes the currently assigned execution policy from the current scope.
                    This parameter will not remove an execution policy that is set in a Group
                    Policy scope.


For more information, please type "Get-ExecutionPolicy -List", "help Set-ExecutionPolicy -Full",
"help about_Execution_Policies" or visit https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849812.aspx
or http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.

.EXAMPLE
New-Item -ItemType File -Path C:\Temp\Get-HashValue.ps1
Creates an empty ps1-file to the C:\Temp directory. The New-Item cmdlet has an inherent -NoClobber mode
built into it, so that the procedure will halt, if overwriting (replacing the contents) of an existing
file is about to happen. Overwriting a file with the New-Item cmdlet requires using the Force. If the
path name includes space characters, please enclose the path name in quotation marks (single or double):

    New-Item -ItemType File -Path "C:\Folder Name\Get-HashValue.ps1"

For more information, please type "help New-Item -Full".
